These were the guidelines that needed to be followed based off the data a team chose. Teams only did time series, multi-nomial logit, or Poisson GLM. My team did a mix of time series and multi-nomial logit. Not everything from the multi-nomial logit section was required to be answered for my group since we also did time series analysis.

If using time series data:
  1. Explain what you’re planning to do. Would it be studying/forecasting of a particular time series variable (or multiple variables)? Or analyzing relationships between multiple time series variables?
  2. If studying/forecasting particular variables, provides the methods and expected pipeline of your actions (including “stationarization”, model selection, diagnostics, forecasting accuracy evaluation).
  3. If analyzing relationships (dynamic regression, etc), describe the method(s) you plan on using, what kind of analysis you will be conducting. Provide alternative analysis methods, to compare with time series-tailored ones we covered in the course.
  
 If using multi-nomial logit:
   1. Outline the response and predictor variables, laying out the full model formulation.
   2. Point out predictors you are most interested in seeing in terms of their relationship with the response (make sure to point out at least one interaction as well). How do you plan to test these relationships? What about the significance of the overall model?
   3. Describe some model diagnostics that might be appropriate here (in analogy to the ways we studiedresiduals diagnostics, influential outliers for classic linear regression).
   4. How do you plan on evaluating predictive performance of your model? Any other models you’d like tocompare it’s performance against (need to use stuff you’ve learnt from the “Machine Learning” course)?
   
 If using Poisson GLM:
  1. Outline the response and predictor variables, laying out the full model formulation.
  2. Point out predictors you are most interested in seeing in terms of their relationship with the response (make sure to point out at least one interaction as well). How do you plan to test these relationships? What about the significance of the overall model?
  3. Make sure to list the issues you need to look out for when using Poisson regression in studying count data, and how these issues can be addressed.
  4. How do you plan on evaluating predictive performance of your model? Any other models you’d like tocompare it’s performance against (need to use stuff you’ve learnt from the “Machine Learning” course)?
